Daily Overview on Instagram: “Our new book “Overview” (link in profile) contains 70 images that have never been posted on our feed before! Here’s one that captures the natural beauty of Mount Fuji — an active stratovolcano and the tallest peak in Japan, rising 3,776 meters (12,389 feet). As seen in this Overview, Fuji has an extremely symmetrical cone, which is snow‑capped several months of the year. During warmer months, climbing routes make it possible for hundreds of thousands of people to scale the volcano each year. /// Created by @benjaminrgrant, source imagery @digitalglobe”
